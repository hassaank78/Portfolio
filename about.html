        <p>(ABOUT ME)</p>
        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate and motivated student currently in my third year of pursuing a BSc in Information
            Technology at RJ College. With a solid foundation in IT and a strong desire to dive into the world of web
            development, I'm working hard to become a skilled full-stack web developer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've
            gained hands-on experience with languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as backend technologies like
            PHP
            and databases. I'm always expanding my skills and checking out new frameworks and libraries to keep up with
            the
            ever-evolving world of web development.</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a versatile full-stack web developer, capable of crafting robust and
            user-friendly applications from scratch. With a commitment to continuous learning and a genuine passion for
            solving problems, I'm determined to push my limits in the realm of web development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know a bit about me. I'm enthusiastic about contributing my skills
            and excitement to the world of web development, creating digital experiences that make a lasting impression.
        </p>
